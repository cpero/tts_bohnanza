# Bohnanza Scripted

In order to get this working for development, you will need to do the following:

    Install VSCode and "Tabletop Simulator Editor" extension
    Create the folder '~/Documents/My Games/Tabletop Simulator/Tabletop Simulator Lua'
    In the new lua folder, clone this into 'Bohnanza' directory
    Change VSCode settings for 'tts':
        enable TS to Lua
    Copy "TS_Save_1.*" to "Tabletop Simulator/Saves/"

"Tabletop Simulator Editor" (currently) has great documentation explaining bundling and LUA autocompletion setup.
